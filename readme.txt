== Description ==

Linklay is a tool to convert images into interactive shoppable images. More than just an image mapping tool, Linklay has inbuilt analytics, auto-applied UTM links, Pinterest-friendly and much more!

Linklay Embed allows users to easily embed a [Linklay shoppable image](https://linklay.com/) in a post or a page using a simple shortcode.

Pattern: [linklay]linklay59fff9229e4fe6.97620297[/linklay]

Inserting a shortcode using the pattern above will display the referenced shoppable image. You can find the code in the HTML supplied on the Linklay application.

Shortcode configuration:

The following attributes can be used to configure the display of the Linklay image's iframe and/or the style of its wrapper:

* class
    * A CSS class that will be applied to an outer wrapper (div). Defaults to none.
    * Example: [linklay class="my_awesome_class"]linklay59fff9229e4fe6.97620297[/linklay]
* align
    * Horizontal alignment of the linklay image within the container: left, center or right. Default: center. The _align_ parameter has no effect if the original image is as wide or wider than the parent element.
    * Example: [linklay align="center"]linklay59fff9229e4fe6.97620297[/linklay]
